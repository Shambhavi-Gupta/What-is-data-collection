Data collection

Data collection is the systematic approach to gathering and measuring information from
a variety of sources to get a complete and accurate picture of an area of interest. Data
collection enables a person or organization to answer relevant questions, evaluate 
outcomes and make predictions about future probabilities and trends.

Accurate data collection is essential to maintaining the integrity of research, making 
informed business decisions and ensuring quality assurance. For example, in retail sales,
data might be collected from mobile applications, website visits, loyalty programs and
online surveys to learn more about customers. In a server consolidation project, data 
collection would include not just a physical inventory of all servers, but also an 
exact description of what is installed on each server -- the operating system, 
middleware and the application or database that the server supports. 

Big data and data collection
Big data describes voluminous amounts of structured, semi-structured and unstructured
data collected by organizations. But because it takes a lot of time and money to load
big data into a traditional relational database for analysis, new approaches for 
collecting and analyzing data have emerged. To gather and then mine big data for
information, raw data with extended metadata is aggregated in a data lake. From there,
machine learning and artificial intelligence programs use complex algorithms to look
for repeatable patterns. 

Types of data
Generally, there are two types of data: quantitative data and qualitative data. 
Quantitative data is any data that is in numerical form -- e.g., statistics and 
percentages. Qualitative data is descriptive data -- e.g., color, smell, appearance 
and quality.
